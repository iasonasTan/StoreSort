# Index Sort
This is a sorting algorithm **I invented**...
I'm not sure if I invented it or if it already existed...
This algorithm basically uses array indexes to store the item's possition and count how much times it exists and then it extracts it into the original array.

## struct Array
This program uses struct Array, which contains an integer pointer which is a pointer to the first element of the array and an integer which is the length of the array.
